--------

accumulator:
    A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.

counter:
    A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something
    happened. We initialize a counter to zero and then increment the
    counter each time we want to "count" something.

decrement:
  An update that decreases the value of a variable.

initialize:
    An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be
    updated.

increment:
    An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one).

infinite loop:
    A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied or for
    which there is no terminating condition.

iteration:
    Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function
    that calls itself or a loop.
