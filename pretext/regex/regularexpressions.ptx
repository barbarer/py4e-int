  <p>So far we have been reading through files, looking for patterns and
            extracting various bits of lines that we find interesting. We have been using string methods like <c>split</c> and <c>find</c> and using lists and string slicing to extract portions of the lines.</p>
  <p>This task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a
            very powerful library called <term>regular expressions</term> that
            handles many of these tasks quite elegantly. The reason we have not
            introduced regular expressions earlier in the book is because while they
            are very powerful, they are a little complicated and their syntax takes
            some getting used to.</p>
  <p>Regular expressions are almost their own little programming language for
            searching and parsing strings. As a matter of fact, entire books have
            been written on the topic of regular expressions. In this chapter, we
            will only cover the basics of regular expressions. For more detail on
            regular expressions, see:</p>

  <p>The regular expression library <c>re</c> must be imported into
            your program before you can use it. The simplest use of the regular
            expression library is the <c>search()</c> function. The following
            program demonstrates a trivial use of the search function.</p>
  <exercise label="re_ac1">
    <statement>
      <p>This code uses regular expressions to print lines that contain <q>From:</q>.</p>
    </statement>
    <program xml:id="re_ac1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:', line):
        print(line)
        </input>
    </program>
  </exercise>
  <p>We open the file, loop through each line, and use the regular expression
            <c>search()</c> to only print out lines that contain the string
            <q>From:</q>. This program does not use the real power of regular
            expressions, since we could have just as easily used
            <c>line.find()</c> to accomplish the same result.</p>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>import re</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Correct! This is the proper way to import the regular expression library.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>import regular_expressions</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>This is not the module name.  It is much shorter.</p>
        </feedback>

  <p>The power of the regular expressions comes when we add special
            characters to the search string that allow us to more precisely control
            which lines match the string. Adding these special characters to our
            regular expression allow us to do sophisticated matching and extraction
            while writing very little code.</p>
  <p>For example, the caret character is used in regular expressions to match
            <q>the beginning</q> of a line. We could change our program to only match
            lines where <q>From:</q> was at the beginning of the line as follows:</p>
  <exercise label="re-ac2">
    <statement>
      <p>Using regular expressions to print lines that contain <q>From:</q> at the beginning of the line.</p>
    </statement>
    <program xml:id="re-ac2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:', line):
        print(line)
        </input>
    </program>
  </exercise>
  <p>Now we will only match lines that <em>start with</em> the string
            <q>From:</q>. This is still a very simple example that we could have done
            equivalently with the <c>startswith()</c> method from the string
            library. But it serves to introduce the notion that regular expressions
            contain special action characters that give us more control as to what
            will match the regular expression.</p>
