      <title>Two-Way Decisions</title>
      <p>Although the simple <c>if</c> statement that you saw in <xref ref="conditional_conditional-execution"/> is useful, it only takes an action when the condition is <c>True</c>. Otherwise, it does nothing. In most programs, it is more common to have a <q>two-way</q> decision such as the following (phrased in English)</p>
      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your age is greater than 65, you get a 15% discount; otherwise, you get a 5% discount.</li>
          <li>If the amount is greater than zero and less than the balance, subtract the amount from the balance; otherwise, tell the customer the amount is wrong.</li>
          <li>If the year is a leap year, set the number of days for February to 29; otherwise set the nuber of days to 28.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <p>To handle these decisions, we use a second form of the <c>if</c> statement: <em>alternative
                execution</em>, in which there are two possibilities and the
            condition determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like
            this:</p>
  <program xml:id="cndtnlMod" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
x = 8
if x % 2 == 0 :
    print('x is even')
else :
    print('x is odd')
print('All done.')
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>If the remainder when <c>x</c> is divided by 2 is 0, then we know
            that <c>x</c> is even, and the program displays a message to that
            effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is
            executed. <xref ref="figure_alternative_if"/> shows the flowchart for this code.</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure_alternative_if">
              <title>Flowchart of an <c>if</c>-<c>else</c></title>
              <caption>Flowchart of an <c>if</c>-<c>else</c></caption>
  <image source="images/if-else.svg" width="50%" alt="If-Then-Else Logic"/>
</figure>
  <p>Since the condition must either be true or false, exactly one of the
            alternatives will be executed. The alternatives are called <em>branches</em>,
            because they are branches in the flow of execution.</p>

      <p>Q-2: What does the following code print?</p>
      <program language="python">

          <p>WEIRD</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>WEIRD is printed by the <c>if</c>-block, which only executes when the conditional (in this case, <c>4&#160;+&#160;5&#160;== &#160;10</c>) is true.  However, 5 + 4 is not equal to 10, so the condition is <c>False</c>.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>GREAT</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Since <c>4&#160;+&#160;5&#160;==&#160;10</c> evaluates to <c>False</c>, Python will skip over the <c>if</c> block and execute the statement in the <c>else</c> block.</p>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>WEIRD on one line and GREAT on the next</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Python would never print both WEIRD and GREAT because it will only execute either the <c>if</c>-block or the <c>else</c>-block, but not both.</p>

        <feedback>
          <p>Python will always execute either the <c>if</c>-block (when the condition is true) or the <c>else</c>-block (when the condition is false).  It will never skip over both blocks.</p>

        <feedback>
          <p>Python will also execute the statement that follows the <c>if</c>-block because it is not enclosed in an <c>else</c>-block, but rather just a normal statement. Notice also that <c>print("This is always printed")</c> is not indented.</p>

          <p>It is valid to have an <c>if</c>-block without a corresponding <c>else</c>-block, as we saw in <xref ref="conditional_conditional-execution">an example in the preceding section</xref>. However, you cannot have an <c>else</c>-block without a corresponding <c>if</c>-block).</p>
