  <title>Dictionary as a Set of Counters</title>

  <p>Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each
            letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>.  You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet.</title>
      <p>Then you could traverse the string and, for each character,
                        increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained
                        conditional.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>.  You could create a list with 26 elements.</title>
      <p>Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function
                        <c>ord</c>), use the number as an index into the list, and
                        increment the appropriate counter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>.  You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values.</title>
      <p>The first time you see a character, you
                        would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment
                        the value of an existing item.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <p>Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them
            implements that computation in a different way.</p>
  <p>An <em>implementation</em> is a way of performing a computation;
            some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage
            of the dictionary implementation is that we don't have to know ahead of
            time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room
            for the letters that do appear.</p>
  <p>Here is what the code might look like:</p>
  <program xml:id="brontosaurausexample" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    if c not in d:
        d[c] = 1
    else:
        d[c] = d[c] + 1
print(d)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>We are effectively computing a <em>histogram</em>, which is a
            statistical term for a set of counters (or frequencies).</p>
  <p>The <title_reference>for</title_reference> loop traverses the string. Each time through the
            loop, if the character <title_reference>c</title_reference> is not in the dictionary, we
            create a new item with key <title_reference>c</title_reference> and the initial value 1 (since
            we have seen this letter once). If <title_reference>c</title_reference> is already in the
            dictionary we increment <title_reference>d[c]</title_reference>.</p>
  <p>Here's the output of the program:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The histogram indicates that the letters <q>a</q> and <q>b</q>
            appear once; <q>o</q> appears twice, and so on.</p>

  <p>Dictionaries have a method called <title_reference>get</title_reference> that takes a key and
            a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, <title_reference>get</title_reference>
            returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value.
            For example:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(counts.get('jan', 0))
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(counts.get('tim', 0))
0
</input>
  </program>

      <p>Q-3: Which use of the get method correctly returns the amount of times the name <q>Russell</q> appears in the dictionary names?</p>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>names.get('Russell')</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Try again! There is no default value, so it will not return anything. The statement is also not being printed out.</p>

        <feedback>
          <p>Correct! This line of code uses print so that the number is printed and not just returned, and it makes sure to include the default value in case 'Russell' does not appear in the dictionary.</p>

  <p>We can use <c>get</c> to write our histogram loop more concisely.
            Because the <c>get</c> method automatically handles the case where
            a key is not in a dictionary, we can reduce four lines down to one and
            eliminate the <c>if</c> statement.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    d[c] = d.get(c,0) + 1
print(d)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The use of the <c>get</c> method to simplify this counting loop
            ends up being a very commonly used <q>idiom</q> in Python and we will use it
            many times in the rest of the book. So you should take a moment and
            compare the loop using the <c>if</c> statement and <c>in</c>
            operator with the loop using the <c>get</c> method. They do
            exactly the same thing, but one is more succinct.</p>

          <p>0</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Correct! Since there isn't a "d" in word, the code returns the default value.</p>
