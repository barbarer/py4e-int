<idx>Shape Error</idx>
  <p>Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as <term>data
                structures</term>. In this chapter, we have started to see <term>compound</term>
            data structures, like lists of tuples and dictionaries with
            tuples as keys and lists as values.</p>
  <p>Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to <em>shape errors</em>;
            that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or
            composition, or perhaps you write some code and forget the shape of your
            data and introduce an error. For example, if you are expecting a list containing
            one integer and I just give you an integer that isn't in a list, it won't work.</p>
