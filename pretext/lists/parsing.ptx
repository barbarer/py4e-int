        <p>Usually when we are reading a file we want to do something to the lines
            other than just printing the whole line. Often we want to find the
            <q>interesting lines</q> and then <em>parse</em> the line to find
            some interesting <em>part</em> of the line. What if we wanted to print out the
            day of the week from those lines that start with <q>From </q>?</p>

        <p>The <c>split</c> method is very effective when faced with this
            kind of problem. We can write a small program that looks for lines where
            the line starts with <q>From </q>, <c>split</c> those lines, and then
            print out the third word in the line:</p>

    <program xml:id="listParsing" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
fhand = open('mboxShort.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From '): continue
    words = line.split()
    print(words[2])

# Continue is used here to skip the rest of the line if it doesn't start with "From "
        </input>
    </program>
        <p>Later, we will learn increasingly sophisticated techniques for picking
            the lines to work on and how we pull those lines apart to find the exact
            bit of information we are looking for.</p>
