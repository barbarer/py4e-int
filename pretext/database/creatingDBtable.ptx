  <p>Databases require more defined structure than Python lists or
    dictionaries <fn>SQLite actually does allow some flexibility in the type of data stored in a column,
                but we will keep our data types strict in this chapter so the concepts apply equally
                to other database systems such as MySQL</fn>.</p>
  <p>When we create a database <em>table</em> we must tell the
            database in advance the names of each of the <em>columns</em> in
            the table and the type of data which we are planning to store in each
            <em>column</em>. When the database software knows the type of
            data in each column, it can choose the most efficient way to store and
            look up the data based on the type of data.</p>

  <p>You can look at the various data types supported by SQLite at the
            following url:</p>
  <p>
    <url href="http://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html" visual="http://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html">http://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html</url>
  </p>
  <p>Defining structure for your data up front may seem inconvenient at the
            beginning, but the payoff is fast access to your data even when the
            database contains a large amount of data.</p>
  <p>The code to create a database file and a table named <c>Tracks</c>
            with two columns in the database is as follows:</p>
  <pre>import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks')
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')

conn.close()</pre>
  <p>The <c>connect</c> operation makes a <q>connection</q> to the database
            stored in the file <c>music.sqlite3</c> in the current directory.
            If the file does not exist, it will be created. The reason this is
            called a <q>connection</q> is that sometimes the database is stored on a
            separate <q>database server</q> from the server on which we are running our
            application. In our simple examples the database will just be a local
            file in the same directory as the Python code we are running.</p>
  <p>A <em>cursor</em> is like a file handle that we can use to
            perform operations on the data stored in the database. Calling
            <c>cursor()</c> is very similar conceptually to calling
            <c>open()</c> when dealing with text files.</p>

  <p>Database commands are expressed in a special language that has been
            standardized across many different database vendors to allow us to learn
            a single database language. The database language is called
            <em>Structured Query Language</em> or <em>SQL</em> for
            short.</p>

  <p>In our example, we are executing two SQL commands in our database. As a
            convention, we will show the SQL keywords in uppercase and the parts of
            the command that we are adding (such as the table and column names) will
            be shown in lowercase.</p>
  <p>The first SQL command removes the <c>Tracks</c> table from the
            database if it exists. This pattern is simply to allow us to run the
            same program to create the <c>Tracks</c> table over and over again
            without causing an error. Note that the <c>DROP TABLE</c> command
            deletes the table and all of its contents from the database (i.e., there
            is no <q>undo</q>).</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tracks ')
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The second command creates a table named <c>Tracks</c> with a text
            column named <c>title</c> and an integer column named
            <c>plays</c>.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE Tracks (title TEXT, plays INTEGER)')
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Now that we have created a table named <c>Tracks</c>, we can put
            some data into that table using the SQL <c>INSERT</c> operation.
            Again, we begin by making a connection to the database and getting a
            <c>cursor</c> object. We can then execute SQL commands using the cursor.</p>
  <p>The SQL <c>INSERT</c> command indicates which table we are using
            and then defines a new row by listing the fields we want to include
            <c>(title, plays)</c> followed by the <c>VALUES</c> we want
            placed in the new row. We specify the values as question marks <c>(?,
?)</c> to indicate that the actual values are passed in as a tuple
            <c>( 'My Way', 15 )</c> as the second parameter to the
            <c>execute()</c> call.</p>
  <pre>import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('music.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
    ('Thunderstruck', 20))
cur.execute('INSERT INTO Tracks (title, plays) VALUES (?, ?)',
    ('My Way', 15))
conn.commit()

print('Tracks:')
cur.execute('SELECT title, plays FROM Tracks')
for row in cur:
     print(row)

cur.execute('DELETE FROM Tracks WHERE plays &lt; 100')
conn.commit()

cur.close()</pre>
  <p>First we <c>INSERT</c> two rows into our table and use
            <c>commit()</c> to force the data to be written to the database
            file.</p>
  <figure align="">
    <image source="images/tracks.svg" width="50%" alt="Rows in a Table"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Then we use the <c>SELECT</c> command to retrieve the rows we just
            inserted from the table. On the <c>SELECT</c> command, we indicate
            which columns we would like <c>(title, plays)</c> and indicate
            which table we want to retrieve the data from. After we execute the
            <c>SELECT</c> statement, the cursor is something we can loop
            through in a <c>for</c> statement. For efficiency, the cursor does
            not read all of the data from the database when we execute the
            <c>SELECT</c> statement. Instead, the data is read on demand as we
            loop through the rows in the <c>for</c> statement.</p>
  <p>The output of the program is as follows:</p>
  <pre>Tracks:
('Thunderstruck', 20)
('My Way', 15)</pre>
  <p>Our <c>for</c> loop finds two rows, and each row is a Python tuple
            with the first value as the <c>title</c> and the second value as
            the number of <c>plays</c>.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Note: You may see strings starting with <c>u'</c> in other books or on the Internet.
                This was an indication in Python 2 that the strings are <em>Unicode</em> strings that are capable
                of storing non-Latin character sets. In Python 3, all strings are unicode
                strings by default.</p>
  </note>
  <p>At the very end of the program, we execute an SQL command to
            <c>DELETE</c> the rows we have just created so we can run the
            program over and over. The <c>DELETE</c> command shows the use of
            a <c>WHERE</c> clause that allows us to express a selection
            criterion so that we can ask the database to apply the command to only
            the rows that match the criterion. In this example the criterion happens
            to apply to all the rows so we empty the table out so we can run the
            program repeatedly. After the <c>DELETE</c> is performed, we also
            call <c>commit()</c> to force the data to be removed from the
            database.</p>
