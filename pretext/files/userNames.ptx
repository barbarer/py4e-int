  <title>Letting the user choose the file name</title>
    <idx><h>File</h><h>Name</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Name</h><h>File</h></idx>
  <p>We really do not want to have to edit our Python code every time we want
            to process a different file. It would be more usable to ask the user to
            enter the file name string each time the program runs so they can use
            our program on different files without changing the Python code.</p>
  <p>This is quite simple to do by reading the file name from the user using
            <c>input</c> as follows:</p>
  <program language="fileInput">
    <input>
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
fhand.close()
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>We read the file name from the user and place it in a variable named
            <c>fname</c> and open that file. Now we can run the program
            repeatedly on different files.</p>
  <pre> python search6.py # seach6.py is the file containing the above script.
 Enter the file name: mbox.txt
 There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt

 python search6.py
  Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
There were 27 subject lines in mbox-short.txt</pre>

  <p>Before peeking at the next section, take a look at the above program and
            ask yourself, <q>What could go possibly wrong here?</q> or <q>What might our
            friendly user do that would cause our nice little program to
            ungracefully exit with a traceback, making us look not-so-cool in the
            eyes of our users?</q></p>
