  <p>While the <em>file handle</em> object does not contain the actual data in the
            file, it is quite easy to construct a <c>for</c> loop to read
            through and count each of the lines in a file:</p>
  <program xml:id="fileLines" interactive="activecode" language="python" datafile="files/mbox-short.txt">
    <input>
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>We can use the file handle object in a <c>for</c> loop.
            Our <c>for</c> loop simply counts the number of lines in the file
            and prints them out. The rough translation of the <c>for</c> loop
            into English is, <q>for each line in the file represented by the file
            handle object, add one to the <c>count</c> variable.</q></p>
  <p>The reason that the <c>open</c> function does not read the entire
            file is that the file might be quite large with many gigabytes of data.
            The <c>open</c> statement takes the same amount of time regardless
            of the size of the file. The <c>for</c> loop actually causes the
            data to be read from the file.</p>
  <p>When the file is read using a <c>for</c> loop in this manner,
            Python takes care of splitting the data in the file into separate lines
            using the newline character. Python reads each line through the newline
            and includes the newline as the last character in the <c>line</c>
            variable for each iteration of the <c>for</c> loop.</p>
  <p>Because the <c>for</c> loop reads the data one line at a time, it
            can efficiently read and count the lines in very large files without
            running out of main memory to store the data. The above program can
            count the lines in any size file using very little memory since each
            line is read, counted, and then discarded.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Q-2: When using a for loop to read lines, how many lines are read at a time? <var/>  </p>
    </statement>
    <setup>
      <var>
        <condition string="([Oo]ne)|1">
          <feedback>
            <p>When using a for loop, the program reads each line individually.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string=".*">
          <feedback>
            <p>Try again.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
      </var>
    </setup>
  </exercise>
  <p>If you know the file is relatively small compared to the size of your
            main memory, you can read the whole file into one string using the
            <c>read</c> method on the file handle.</p>
  <program xml:id="fileSlice" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
inp = fhand.read()
print(len(inp))
print(inp[:20])
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example, the entire contents (all 94,626 characters) of the file
            <em>mbox-short.txt</em> are read directly into the variable
            <c>inp</c>. We use string slicing to print out the first 20
            characters of the string data stored in <c>inp</c>.</p>
  <p>When the file is read in this manner, all the characters including all
            of the lines and newline characters are one big string in the variable
            <c>inp</c>. It is a good idea to store the output of <c>read</c> as a variable
            because each call to <c>read</c> exhausts the resource:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(fhand.read()))
94626
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(fhand.read()))
0
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Remember that this form of the <c>open</c> function should only be used
            if the file data will fit comfortably in the main memory of your computer.
            If the file is too large to fit in main memory, you should write your
            program to read the file in chunks using a <c>for</c> or <c>while</c> loop.</p>
