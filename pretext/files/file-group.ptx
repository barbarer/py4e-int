  <title>Group Work: Reading from Files</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>It is best to use a POGIL approach with the following. In POGIL students work
            in groups on activities and each member has an assigned role.  For more information see <url href="https://cspogil.org/Home" visual="https://cspogil.org/Home">https://cspogil.org/Home</url>.</p>
  <note>
    <p>If you work in a group, have only one member of the group fill in the answers on this page.  You will be able to share your answers with the group at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <title>Reading from Files</title>
    <p>To read from a file, open the file which returns a file object and loop through
                the lines in a file.  Remember to close the file when you are done reading from it!</p>

      <statement>
        <p>Run the code below to see what it prints.</p>
      </statement>
      <program xml:id="file_pogil_read_lines_with_loop_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">

      </program>
    </exercise>
    <p>Notice that when you run this code it adds a blank line after each line.
                That is because when you read a line from a file the line contains the newline character (<c>\n</c>).
                When you print a line you add another newline character which prints as a blank line.</p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>Q-2: What string method can you use to remove the newline character from the end of a line? <var/>  </p>

    <p>You can also read all the lines from a file at once into a list.  One advantage
                to this is that you can immediately close the file after that.  This makes it easier to remember to close the file.</p>

    <p>You can also just read some of the lines from a file using the <c>readline</c> method.  This can be handy
                if you just want to see what type of data is in a file, but don't need to see the entire file.</p>
