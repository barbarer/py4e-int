  <p>This works because <c>zari</c> is a turtle, and each statement gets executed, one right after the other.  If we introduce another turtle and another name, it doesn't work the same</p>

  <p>Every turtle object has its own attributes like its current position and color.  So, when we created chad his position was different from zari's.  Turtles start off in the center of the drawing space when they are first created.</p>
