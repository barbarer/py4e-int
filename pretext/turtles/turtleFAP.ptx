  <title>Turtle Methods</title>
  <p>Turtles can do more than go forward, turn left, and turn right.  The table below lists the turtle methods.  Methods are functions that are defined in a class.  A class defines what all objects of the class know (the data each object keeps track of) and can do (the behaviors an object can execute).  You can think of a class as like a classification (type of thing).</p>
