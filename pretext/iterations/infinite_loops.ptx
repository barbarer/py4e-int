  <p>An endless source of amusement for programmers is the observation that
            the directions on shampoo, <q>Lather, rinse, repeat,</q> are an infinite loop
            because there is no <em>iteration variable</em> telling you how
            many times to execute the loop.</p>
  <p>In some loops, like the countdown from last section, we can prove that the loop
            terminates because we know that the value of <c>n</c> is finite,
            and we can see that the value of <c>n</c> gets smaller each time
            through the loop, so eventually we'll reach 0. Other times a loop
            is obviously infinite because it has no iteration variable at all.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half way
            through the body. In that case you can write an infinite loop on purpose
            and then use the <c>break</c> statement to jump out of the loop.</p>
  <p>This loop is obviously an <em>infinite loop</em> because the
            logical expression on the <c>while</c> statement is simply the
            logical constant <c>True</c>:</p>
  <program xml:id="codelens531" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
n = 10
while True:
    print(n, end=' ')
    n = n - 1
print('Done!')
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>As you can see above, the Code Lens gives you a warning because it runs for over 1000 steps.
            If you make the mistake of running this code, you will learn quickly how to
            stop a runaway Python process on your system or find where the power-off
            button is on your computer. This program will run forever or until your
            battery runs out because the logical expression at the top of the loop
            is always true by virtue of the fact that the expression is the constant
            value <c>True</c>.</p>
  <p>While this is a dysfunctional infinite loop, we can still use this
            pattern to build useful loops as long as we carefully add code to the
            body of the loop to explicitly exit the loop using <c>break</c>
            when we have reached the exit condition.</p>
  <p>For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they
            type <c>done</c>. You could write:</p>
  <program language="05section3">
    <input>
while True:
    line = input('Word: ')
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print ('Done!')
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The loop condition is <c>True</c>, which is always true, so the
            loop runs repeatedly until it hits the break statement.</p>

      <p>Q-2: At what word will the while loop pictured above terminate? <var/>  </p>
    </statement>
    <setup>
      <var>
        <condition string="done">
          <feedback>
            <p>The while loop will end when the user types <q>done</q></p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string="Done">
          <feedback>
            <p>Incorrect! The conditions of the while loop are case specific. Try again.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string=".*">
          <feedback>
            <p>Incorrect! Look closely at the code above. Try again.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
      </var>
    </setup>
  </exercise>
  <p>Each time through, it prompts the user with <c>Word:</c>. If the
            user types <c>done</c>, the <c>break</c> statement exits the
            loop. Otherwise, the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back
            to the top of the loop. Here's a sample run:</p>
  <pre>Word: hello there
hello there
Word: finished
finished
Word: done
Done!</pre>
  <p>This way of writing <c>while</c> loops is common because you can
            check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you
            can express the stop condition affirmatively (<q>stop when this happens</q>)
            rather than negatively (<q>keep going until that happens.</q>).</p>
