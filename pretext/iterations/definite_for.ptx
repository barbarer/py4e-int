  <p>Sometimes we want to loop through a <em>set</em> of things, such
            as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we
            have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a <em>definite</em>
            loop using a <c>for</c> statement. We call the <c>while</c>
            statement an <em>indefinite</em> loop because it simply loops until some
            condition becomes <c>False</c>, whereas the <c>for</c> loop
            is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many
            iterations as there are items in the set.</p>

  <p>The syntax of a <c>for</c> loop is similar to the
            <c>while</c> loop in that there is a <c>for</c> statement
            and a loop body:</p>
  <program xml:id="itr-section5_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print('Done!')
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In Python terms, the variable <c>friends</c> is a list (We will examine lists
            in more detail in a later chapter) of
            three strings. The <c>for</c> loop goes through the list and
            executes the body once for each of the three strings in the list
            resulting in this output:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
Happy New Year: Joseph
Happy New Year: Glenn
Happy New Year: Sally
Done!
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Translating this <c>for</c> loop to English is not as direct as
            the <c>while</c>, but if you think of friends as a <em>set</em>, it goes
            like this: <q>Run the statements in the body of the for loop once
            for each friend <em>in</em> the set named friends.</q></p>
  <p>Looking at the <c>for</c> loop, <em>for</em> and
            <em>in</em> are reserved Python keywords, and
            <c>friend</c> and <c>friends</c> are variables.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
for friend in friends:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>In particular, <c>friend</c> is the <em>iteration
                variable</em> for the for loop. The variable <c>friend</c>
            changes for each iteration of the loop and controls when the
            <c>for</c> loop completes. The <em>iteration variable</em>
            steps successively through the three strings stored in the
            <c>friends</c> variable.</p>
